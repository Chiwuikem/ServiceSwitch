# ServiceSwitch

## Summary
Our Application is a web browser designed to connect locals service providers with other locals or temporary visitors in a given area. This will allow community based services to be found and offered easier. It is inspired by platforms like Angieâ€™s List and Doordash, but the focus has shifted to a niche focused more on personal services rather than home services. Since it has been increasingly harder to find jobs, this application makes it easier for service providers to find customers and for customers to find trusted professionals at a lower cost. 

Service Providers will be able to create profiles that display the services they offer, experience, pricing, and customer reviews. Users will be able to browse through a list of services such as event hosting, barbering, hairstyling, etc within their area. Customers can book services through the platform and negotiate prices if the provider allows it.

## How to Use
Service providers can create a profile by going through the steps to sign up for an account, and then confirming their details by subsequently logging in.
